Structure:
Loan System will have three parts:
1. A container for inputting loan records (upper left half of GUI)
   Columns: Debtor's Name, Debt Date, Debt Amount, Monthly Interest Rate, Total Debt, and Running Balance
2. A container for inputting payment records (lower left half of GUI)
   Columns: Payer's Name, Payment Date, Principal Paid, Interest Paid, Total Payment, and Running Balance
3. A container for a table for viewing loan and payment history (entire right half of GUI)
   Columns: Refer to columns listed for loan and payment above

Database Tables and their Columns:
1. tb_debtor_records: id, name, age, address, phone_number
2. tb_debt_records: id, debtor_id, debt_date, debt_amount, interest_rate, interest_amount, total_debt
3. tb_payment_records: id, debtor_id, payment_date, principal_paid, interest_paid, total_payment
4. tb_balance_records: id, debtor_id, running_balance

Process:
1. Create Triggers and a Trigger Functions that automate the following:
   a. Gets the sum of user-inputted 'debt_amount' and 'interest_amount', then inserts the result in 'total_debt' column;
      also, the said sum will be added to the current record in 'running_balance' column of tb_balance_records
   b. Gets the sum of user-inputted 'principal_paid' and 'interest_paid', then inserts the result in 'total_payment'
      column; also, the said sum will be subtracted to the current record in 'running_balance' column of tb_payment_records
